DOS 94' is simply put, a DOS 6.20 - 6.22 utility shell. 

Named DOS 94', as a parody of  Windows 95,  it sports a 
"Windows 95-like" interface. It's purpose is to provide 
an easy to use launching platform for MS DOS utilites 
such as MS Backup, MS Antivirus, Scandisk, Defrag and 
various other C: prompt commands. It has a nifty floppy 
diskette format applet and a 4 year calender.
If you are a Windows 3.1 user, you can have DOS 94'
launch Windows for you as well.

DOS 94' began as something I did just to kill time. But, 
the more I tweaked it, the more functional it became. 

I am offering this as a free-bee because, like I said,
I was just killing time. 


//// Requirements ////////////////////////////////

Microsoft DOS version 6.20 through 6.22.

Roughly 850K of Hard Disk space on drive C:

This is a completely point and click driven menuing 
system, therefore, of course, a MOUSE IS REQUIRED.

DOS 94' is 32K color, so I strongly recommend a good
SVGA card and monitor. 


////  Tips  ///////////////////////////////////////

If you want DOS 94' to start when you boot up your
computer, enter the following line at the very 
bottom of your AUTOEXEC.BAT  

C:\DOS95\START.EXE

From here, you will have point and click access
to most of the valuable MS DOS utilites.

A lightweight toolbox for quick access to practical features.
OmniTools is a toolbox developed by Omni++ and Happy's Pangolin for DOS.
At present, OmniTools is a formal version, so its functionality may not be complete (it may have very few features). 
We will continue to improve the toolbox (by adding more features).
